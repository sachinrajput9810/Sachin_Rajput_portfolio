# Sachin Rajput's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This site showcases my skills, projects, and experience as a software developer.

## About Me

I am a 2023 graduate from Delhi Technological University, with a strong foundation in web development and programming. I am skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB, and I have a solid command over programming languages like C++, Java, and Python. My expertise extends to data structures and algorithms, which I honed while working as a Teaching Assistant at Pepcoding Education, where I specialized in DSA. I am passionate about problem-solving and always eager to bring my innovative approach to the table.
